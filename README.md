#### About

The **pmac** utility converts PM manifests with domain credentials to manifests with credentials that apply only to a specific URL.

Find all manifests that belong to the same domain and for them look for login forms with domain credentials. 
Then set each of these login forms to be used only for exact matching URLs.
